# 💸 PGPay – Split Expenses Without the Drama

👯‍♂️ **Living in a PG or hostel?**  
😩 **Tired of figuring out who owes what for chai, groceries, or rent?**  

Yep, I’ve been there too. So I built my own app—because hey, I’m a Flutter dev and I wanted it the way more simple.

Sure, the Play Store is full of apps...  
But **PGPay is different:**

✅ **🚫 No sign-ups**  
✅ **🚫 No cloud**  
✅ **🔐 Only you know your data**  
✅ **📱 Everything stays on your phone**

Track who paid, how much each of you used, and settle up in seconds.  
It’s simple, private, and made just for you and your friends.
